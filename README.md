# InfoStealer

## Disclaimer
It should be obvious that this codebase and related executables are only for educational purposes and should never be used for any illegal activity.

## Goals
The goal of this project is to write malware which extracts and sends data to a server, without being detected by Windows Defender or in the best case Virustotal.


The extraction of:
- [ ] discord token/cookies
- [ ] browser tokens/cookies
- [ ] different password related files
- [ ] Browser Passwords and saved payments
- [ ] Crypto wallets

as well as:
- [ ] a keylogger
- [ ] persistance 
- [ ] VM - checks
- [ ] Antivirus evasion

is also planned, although idk how far i will go ;).

## Misc
This project is a continuation of [this](https://github.com/Zelyson/MALWARE-InfoStealer) project which ended due to a lack of experience  
and motivation (which hopefully wont be the case for this one \:)).  
Also, I'm not a C++ developer and this is my first 'real' project so if I've made some  
unforgivable mistakes which would land me in C-hell just send over a pull request ;P.
