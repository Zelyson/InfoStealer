# InfoStealer

## Disclaimer
It should be obvious that this codebase and related executables are only for educational purposes and should never be used for any illegal activity.

## Goals
The goal of this project is to write malware which extracts and sends data to a server, without being detected by Windows Defender or in the best case Virustotal.


The extraction of:
- discord token/cookies
- browser tokens/cookies
- different password related files
- Browser Passwords and saved payments
- Crypto wallets

as well as:
- a keylogger
- persistance 
- VM - checks
- Antivirus evasion

is also planned, although idk how far i will go ;).

## Misc
This project is a continuation of [this](https://github.com/Zelyson/MALWARE-InfoStealer) project
which ended due to a lack of experience and motivation (which hopefully wont be the case for this one \:)).
- Created using Visual Studio Community 2022 ver. 17.8.1
- As the program contains windows only functions, it can only be used on windows machines

Have fun!
